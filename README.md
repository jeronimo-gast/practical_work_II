## Design Detailed Document

### 1. Description of the work

This project consists of the development of a personal website created as part of **Practical Work II** for the subject **Fundamentals of Computer Engineering**.  
The goal of the website is to demonstrate the correct use of **HTML** and **CSS**, while presenting information about my degree, the subject itself, and a specific topic related to computer engineering.

The website was developed using only standard web technologies:

- **HTML** for structure and content  
- **CSS** for layout and design  

No JavaScript or external libraries were used.

### 2. Website structure

The website is divided into the following sections:

- **Home:** Explains the purpose of the website.  
- **About:** Includes personal information, academic background, skills, images, and links to professional profiles.  
- **Degree:** Shows an overview of the Computer Engineering degree, organized by academic year.  
- **FCE:** Dedicated to the Fundamentals of Computer Engineering subject, explaining its content and objectives.  
- **Topic:** Focuses on **Artificial Intelligence in Videogames**, including explanations, examples, images, and external links.  
- **Net:** Contains links to classmates’ websites created for the same subject.  
- **Contact:** Provides a contact form implemented using HTML only.

### 3. Development considerations

Throughout the development process, project structure and consistency were prioritized.  
External CSS files were used to separate design from content, and all images were stored in a dedicated folder to keep the project organized.

Although tools such as JavaScript or frameworks could have been used, the project was intentionally kept simple to meet the subject requirements.

### 4. Problems during the development

There were no major difficulties during the development of the project, as I had previous experience with similar work.  
Most of the effort was focused on refining the design and adapting the content to reflect my current academic progress.

### 5. Conclusions

This project helped reinforce fundamental web development concepts using HTML and CSS, as well as the importance of organization and documentation.  
The final result is a functional and well-structured website that fulfills all the requirements of the practical work.
