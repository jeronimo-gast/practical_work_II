Design Detailed Document

1. Description of the work

This project consists of the development of a personal website created as part of Practical Work II for the subject Fundamentals of Computer Engineering.
The goal of the website is to show the correct use of HTML and CSS, while presenting information about my degree, the subject itself, and a specific topic related to computer engineering.

The website was developed using only standard web technologies:

HTML for structure and content

CSS for layout and design

No JavaScript or external libraries were used.

2. Website structure

The website is divided into several sections:

Home: Explains the purpose of the website.

About: Includes personal information, academic background, skills, images, and links to professional profiles.

Degree: Shows an overview of the Computer Engineering degree, organized by academic year.

FCE: Dedicated to the Fundamentals of Computer Engineering subject, explaining its content and objectives.

Topic: Focuses on Artificial Intelligence in Videogames, including explanations, examples, images, and external links.

Net: Contains links to classmates’ websites created for the same subject.

Contact: Provides a contact form implemented using HTML only.

3. Development considerations

Throughout the development process, the project structure and consistency were prioritized.
External CSS files were used to separate design from content, and all images were stored in a dedicated folder to keep the project organized.

Although additional tools such as JavaScript or frameworks could have been used, the project was intentionally kept simple to fully meet the subject requirements.

4. Problems during the development

There were no major difficulties during the development of the project, as I had previous experience with similar work.
Most of the time was spent refining the design and adapting the content to better reflect my current academic progress.

5. Conclusions

This project helped reinforce key web development concepts using HTML and CSS, as well as the importance of organization and documentation.
The final result is a functional and well-structured website that fulfills all the requirements of the practical work.
