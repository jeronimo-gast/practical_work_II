                <h2>Class Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This class provides a global vision of Computer Engineering from both academic and professional perspectives. It introduces the theoretical foundations of the field while also helping students develop practical skills, particularly in web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The subject is divided into two modules: Theoretical Foundations and Practical Skills.

                <h2>Theoretical Foundations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Computer Engineering in Society:</strong> History, role of engineers, ethical and anthropological foundations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Information and Data:</strong> Representation, data organization, number systems, codes, and data ethics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Processing & Transmission:</strong> Systems, networks, current paradigms (Cloud, AI, IoT, Blockchain, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Practical Skills</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Foundations of Software Development:</strong> Introduction to development environments, version control with Git, and collaborative work using GitHub.</li>
                    <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> Structuring web pages, understanding the DOM, and creating basic forms.</li>
                    <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> Styling web pages, working with layouts, the box model, and positioning elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> Use of the GitHub website and the GitBash commands.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The main practical project of the course consists of designing and developing a personal website using HTML and CSS, applying the concepts learned throughout the subject.
