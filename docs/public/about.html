        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Jeronimo Gast, and I am a Computer Engineering student at
          Universidad Francisco de Vitoria (UFV) with Colombian and German
          background. Growing up surrounded by different cultures has made me
          open-minded, curious, and eager to learn from new experiences. I
          consider myself an extroverted and approachable person who enjoys
          meeting new people and adapting to new environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I am especially passionate about traveling, as it
          allows me to discover new cultures and perspectives. I enjoy exploring
          cities on foot, as I believe walking is the best way to truly
          understand a place. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting in the
          kitchen, even though I still consider myself very much a work in
          progress.

        <h2>My time at UFV</h2>
        <p>
          Moving to Madrid to study at UFV was a major step in my life, and the
          beginning was not easy. During my first year, I faced several
          challenges, especially when adapting to the academic level and keeping
          up with subjects such as mathematics. Adjusting to a new country and
          lifestyle added an extra layer of difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these challenges, the experience helped me grow both
          academically and personally. With the support of the friends I made
          along the way and a stronger work routine, I began to see clear
          improvement. In my second year, I have gained more confidence, better
          organization skills, and a deeper understanding of the subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, my experience at UFV has taught me resilience and
          perseverance, and I am motivated to continue improving and proving
          myself throughout the rest of my degree.
