        <h1>Artificial Intelligence in Videogames</h1>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a key role in modern videogames by
          shaping how players interact with virtual worlds. From enemy behavior
          to adaptive systems and content generation, AI contributes to creating
          immersive and engaging gameplay experiences.

        <h2>What is AI in Videogames?</h2>
        <p>
          In videogames, artificial intelligence refers to the techniques used
          to control non-player characters (NPCs) and also the systems that
          shape and manage the game world itself. AI is what allows enemies to
          react to the player, characters to move around the map, and entire
          worlds to be generated dynamically. Unlike real-world AI, game AI is
          not meant to be perfect or autonomous. Its main goal is to create
          believable and enjoyable experiences for the player, even if that
          means simplifying decisions or bending realism in favor of fun.
        </p>

        <h2>Main Applications of AI in Games</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>NPC Behavior:</strong> Enemies and allies that react to the
            player and the environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pathfinding:</strong> Characters navigating maps efficiently
            using algorithms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Decision Making:</strong> AI selecting actions based on game
            states.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamic Difficulty:</strong> Games adjusting challenge
            levels to match player skill.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>World and Content Generation:</strong> Systems that
            automatically create terrain, environments, creatures, and events.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Benefits and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence improves immersion and replayability by making
          game worlds feel responsive and dynamic. However, AI systems must be
          carefully balanced to avoid unfair difficulty, repetitive behavior, or
          player frustration. As a result, developers often prioritize player
          experience over realism.

        <h2>Case Study: No Man’s Sky</h2>
        <p>
          A notable example of artificial intelligence in videogames is
          <strong>No Man’s Sky</strong>
          , a title that makes extensive use of procedural generation. Instead
          of manually designing every element, algorithms are used to generate
          planets, ecosystems, and creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI-driven systems create terrain, flora, fauna, and space
          environments, allowing the game to feature an almost infinite number
          of unique worlds. This demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be
          applied beyond character behavior to generate large-scale content.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this approach enables impressive scale and variety, it also
          presents challenges. Developers must ensure that procedurally
          generated content remains meaningful and engaging for players over
          time.
